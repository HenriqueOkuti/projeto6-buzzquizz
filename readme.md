# project6-BuzzQuizz

Front-end app implementation for an online pop quizz platform. This is a collaboration project developed during the DRIVEN bootcamp, which also provided the API used on app.

## How to use:

Upon opening you'll see the homepage, your own quizzes and the list of all quizzes on the platform.

You can access a quizz by directly clicking on them, which will redirect you to the "taking the quizz" interface. Select the correct option for each question and the screen will scroll to the next question. Note: Should you click out of order, the screen will scroll to the first unanswered question.

After answering all the questions you'll recieve a score based on your score. Since the quizzes are user made the number of questions and score results may vary.

On the home screen, in case you dont have a quizz made yet you can create one by clicking on the "Criar Quizz" buttom, which will take you to the quizz creation interface.
